Professionally my expierience so far has been predominately backend oriented, but I've made it a personal goal to become a more well rounded developer and explore frontend development in my own time. I'm always eager to learn new things and take up new challenges.
        I created this website to showcase some of the projects I'm working on, so please feel free to take a look around.`
