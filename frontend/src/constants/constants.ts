export const INTRO_BODY = `I'm a Software developer with over two years of experience. So far my work has been predominately backend oriented, but I've made it a personal goal to become as well rounded as possible and most recently have been delving further frontend development in my own time. I'm always eager to learn new things and take on new challenges. I created this website to showcase some of the projects I'm working on, so please feel free to take a look around.`;

//about
export const ABOUT_TITLE = `About Me`;
export const ABOUT_BODY = `I'm a software developer from Lafayette, Louisiana. I discovered my passion for software development while pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Lafayette Louisiana. I realized about halfway through the program that I preferred programming to calculating the heat of resistors and decided to switch to the university's computer science program.
As a professional, my past role in the Marine Corps along with my previous career work have taught me to value effective leadership and communication above all else. It's my firm belief that organizations excel when leaders have a keen interest in the growth of those in their care. I hope to bring these values with me in any future endeavors. I've always been self motivated when it comes to my work approach and gain great satisfaction from finding ways to accomplish tasks more efficiently. 
As for my hobbies, me and my wife love to travel when time permits. In my free time, you'll probably find me at the gym, playing video games, or hanging out with friends.`;
